While developing a program or an application, many developers find themselves more interested
in the type of algorithm used rather than the type of data structure implemented. However, the
choice of data structure used for a particular algorithm is always of the utmost importance. Each
data structure has its own unique properties and is constructed to suit various kinds of applications.
Some of them are highly specialized to carry out specific tasks. For example, B-trees with their
unique ability to organize indexes are well-suited for the implementation of databases. Similarly,
stack, a linear data structure which provides }__last-in-first-out}__ access, is used to store and track
the sequence of web pages while we browse the Internet. Specific data structures are essential
components of many efficient algorithms, and make possible the management of large amounts of
data, such as large databases and Internet indexing services. C, as we all know, is the most popular
programming language and is widespread among all the computer architectures. Therefore, it is
not only logical but also fundamentally essential to start the introduction and implementation of
various data structures through C.
